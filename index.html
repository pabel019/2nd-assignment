        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <h3> A Brief History of the World Wide Web</h3>
    </div>
    <p>Web development is the process of building websites and applications for the internet, or for a private network known as an intranet. Web development is not concerned with the design of a website; rather, it’s all about the coding and programming that powers the website’s functionality.</p>

     <h3>The Difference Between Web Development and Web Design</h3>
     <p>ou might hear the terms web development and web design used interchangeably, but these are two very different things.

        Imagine a web designer and web developer working together to build a car: the developer would take care of all the functional components, like the engine, the wheels and the gears, while the designer would be responsible for both the visual aspects — how the car looks, the layout of the dashboard, the design of the seats — and for the user experience provided by the car, so whether or not it’s a smooth drive.</p>
